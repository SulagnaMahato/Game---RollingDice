# Dice Game

A simple dice game where two players compete to reach 100 points first. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. **Rolling the Dice**: Each player takes turns rolling a dice. When the dice is rolled:
   - If the dice shows a number other than 1, the number is added to the player's current score.
   - If the dice shows 1, the player's current score is reset to 0, and the turn is passed to the other player.

2. **Hold**: The player can choose to "Hold" their current score, which adds the current score to their total score and switches the turn to the other player.

3. **Winning**: The first player to reach or exceed 100 points in their total score wins the game.

4. **New Game**: Press the "New Game" button to reset the scores and start a new game.
